What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it will be initialized as agit repository.There will be zero commits.Git does not automatically make commits because we cant give our own commit messages if git does the commit for us.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is used to specify exactly what changes to be committed. It helps in making the commits small(i.e. one commit per logical change).
