When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we want to collaborate on a project with multiple people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Coz you might want to pull the changed file after you have finished working on a certain logic part .Automatic updating might result in too many unwanted pulls.
